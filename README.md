# Stroop Test Game

## Project Overview

A web-based 1v1 Stroop Test game inspired by the minigame in "The Outlast Trials" that challenges players to quickly and accurately respond to color-word matching challenges. The game tests players' cognitive processing speed and ability to overcome cognitive interference.

### Game Concept

The Stroop Test is a psychological test where players must quickly identify the color of a word, which may or may not match the word's text. For example:
- The word "RED" printed in blue
- The word "GREEN" printed in red

Players compete 1v1 to see who can respond most accurately and quickly.
