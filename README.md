# Stroopy - Multiplayer Stroop Effect Game
A real-time multiplayer game based on the Stroop Effect, built with React, TypeScript, and Socket.IO.

## Project Overview

A real-time 1v1 multiplayer game (and singleplayer) based on the Stroop Test, an experiment that challenges players to quickly and accurately respond to color-word matching tasks. The game tests players' cognitive processing speed and ability to overcome cognitive interference.

### Game Concept

The Stroop Test is a psychological test where players must quickly identify the color of a word, which may or may not match the word's text. For example:
- The word "RED" printed in blue
- The word "GREEN" printed in red

Players compete 1v1 to see who can respond most accurately and quickly.
